TODO:
* Read/Write ID3v2.4 tag footer
* Implement ID3v2.3 Builder
* Implement more known frames currently read as UNKNOWN

MAYBE:
* Writing with unsynchronised data
* Simplify more rare complex frames (e.g. RVA/RVA2/GEOB, ...)
* Support for ID3v1 variants (Extended tag TAG+, APE, CUSTOMTAG) 
* Implement known PRIV Tags (e.g. AverageLevel, WM_MediaClassPrimaryID, ...)
